# hackTAMS_2020fall
For this Hackathon we tried to crate a chatroom website with an html. It didn't work out, because we had problems coding in JavaScript and PHP.
So we decided to make a chatroom with python socket and kivy for the UI
To run create a chatroom run the server. Then run main.py to chat. Note that you have to install kivy to run it.
